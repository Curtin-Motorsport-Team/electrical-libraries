LIBRARY DESCRIPTION:
 * This library allows for the PIC18F46K80 and MCCP2551 CAN hardware node to com-
 * municate with the CAN bus on the CMT '15 vehicle. Primarily it will be linked 
 * with the LINK G4+ ECU CAN bus node. The library functions allow for basic com-
 * munication functionalities such as transmitting, receiving and also initialis-
 * ation of the node itself.

	/* A bit on Masks and Filters!
			
	A filter is the be all and end all, it decides to accept the data to the buffer or 
	dump it. A filter will be composed of a bit field as long as the ID of the CAN message.
	
	If the CAN ID matches the filter it is let throgut to the buffer. 
	
	Now the mask is like a wild	card to the filter. If the corresponding mask bit is a 
	1 then the filter bit MUST match the corresponding ID bit in order for it
	to be passed. If its a 0 then it is a dont care bit. ie
	
	Mask = 	0b01101101
	Filter=	0b11011011
	Passes=	0bx10x10x1 
	  ie	0b11011011
			0b01011011
			0b11001001 ect
	
	Think of the mask as a filter bit enable function,  if it is a 0 it disables that filter
	checking ability*/
