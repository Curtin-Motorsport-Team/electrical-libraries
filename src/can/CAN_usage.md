Breaking Down The CAN File
==========================

Going through the CAN file:

```c
#include<pic18f46k80.h>
#include <xc.h>
#include "CAN.h"

extern unsigned char data[8];
```


Initialise Function
-------------------

### Initial Configuration

CAN needs to be in CONFIG mode to edit the following settings, in order to get there it must shut it the module down and restat it in config mode. We do that by editing CANCONbits.REQOP (Bits 7-5).

```c
CANCON = 0b10000000;
```

To ensure we don't proceed before we have changed to CONFIG mode, we check poll CANSTATbits.OPMODE and wait for it to change to 0b100; indicating it has gone into the correct mode.

```c
while(!(CANSTATbits.OPMODE == 0b100));
```

The PIC's CAN module has 3 modes, 2 of which are "CAN" and "ECAN" (see pg 439 of datasheet). We use "CAN" and "ECAN" is a newer version, enhanced legacy mode mode is basically CAN, but a little bit better. Here we set the module to mode 1, enhanced legacy.

```c
ECANCON = 0b01000000;
```


### Baudrate Adjustment
The can message timing is comprised of many chunks of time, Time Quanta (TQ). The total baudrate is then calculated by how many and how long the TQs are used.

The Nominal Bit Time (NBT), is comprised of 4 individual sections of time, each being comprised of integer numbers of TQs.

![alt text](https://github.com/Curtin-Motorsport-Team/electrical-libraries/raw/master/src/can/TimeSegments.png "Timing Makeup")

The Synchronization Segment (SyncSeg) is the first segment in the NBT and is used to synchronize the nodes on the bus. Bit edges are expected to occur within the SyncSeg. This segment is fixed at 1TQ.

The Propagation Segment (PropSeg) exists to compensate for physical delays between nodes. The propagation delay is defined as twice the sum of the signal’s propagation time on the bus line, including the delays associated with the bus driver. The PropSeg is programmable from 1 - 8TQ.

The two phase segments, PS1 and PS2 are used to compensate for edge phase errors on the bus. PS1 can be lengthened or PS2 can be shortened by resyncronization. PS1 is programmable from 1 - 8TQ and PS2 is programmable from 2 - 8TQ.

The sample point is the point in the bit time in which the logic level is read and interpreted. The sample point is located at the end of phase segment 1. The exception to this rule is, if the sample mode is configured to sample three times per bit. In this case, the bit is still sampled at the end of PS1, however, two additional samples are taken at one-half TQ intervals prior to the end of PS1 and the value of the bit is determined by a majority decision.

The are several requirements for programming the CAN bit timing segments.

1. PropSeg + PS1 ≥ PS2
2. PropSeg + PS1 ≥ tPROP
3. PS2 > SJW

The actual time value for a time quanta is defined as:

```
TQ = 2 * BRP * Tosc
NBR = 1/[(Tss + Tps + Tps1 + Tps2)*TQ]
```

Where the BRP is the baud rate prescaller as defined in the BRGCON1 register. Thus for a 1 MBit/s baud rate running at a 16 MHz we can get a solution set such that, With BRP = 1:

| SyncSeg  | PropSeg  | SEG1  | SEG2 |
|:--------:|:--------:|:-----:|:---:|
| 1  | 1 | 4 |2|



### BRGCON1

Sync Jump Width is 1 TQ:
```c
BRGCON1bits.SJW = 0b00;
```
Baud Rate Prescaler is Tq = 2*(BRP + 1)/Fosc = 0.125 us
```c
BRGCON1bits.BRP = 0;
```


### BRGCON2

Make the SEG2 fully programmable
```c
BRGCON2bits.SEG2PHTS = 1;
```
On reception the bit is sampled once at the intersection of SEG1 and SEG2
```
BRGCON2bits.SAM = 0;
```
SEG1 is 4*TQ
```c
BRGCON2bits.SEG1PH = 0b011;
```
Propogation time is 1*TQ
```
BRGCON2bits.PRSEG = 0b000;
```

### BREGCON3

Enable wakeup from CAN
```c
BRGCON3bits.WAKDIS = 0;
```

Disable filters for wakeup
```c
BRGCON3bits.WAKFIL = 0;
```

SEG2 is 2*TQ
```c
BRGCON3bits.SEG2PH = 0b001;
```

### Selectable Buffer Types
There are two recieve only buffers, a few transmit only buffers and 5 either ors. Here we set them all to Tx buffers.

```c
BSEL0 = 0b11111100;
```

### Masks and Filters!

A filter is the be all and end all, it decides to accept the data to the buffer or dump it. A filter will be composed of a bit field as long as the ID of the CAN message. If the CAN ID matches the filter it is let throgut to the buffer and you have the data in a handy dandy package ready to be read.

Now the mask is like a wild card to the filter. If the corresponding mask bit is a 1 then the filter bit MUST match the corresponding ID bit in order for it to be passed to the buffer. If its a 0 then it will ignore the filters. ie

Mask = 	0b01101101
Filter=	0b11011011

Passes=	0bx10x10x1
ie	0b11011011
	0b01011011
	0b11001001 ect

Think of the mask as a filter bit enable function, if it is a 0 it disables that filter checking ability for that given bit.


### Initialize Receive Masks and Filters

The first mask is used that accepts all SIDs. Standard ID MASK all 1s, meaning the filter must match EXACTLY!
```c
RXM0SIDH = 0b11111111;
RXM0SIDL = 0b11100000;
```

Enable Filters. Only using first three filters
```c
RXFCON0 = 0b00000111;	//Enable Filters 0,1,2
RXFCON1 = 0b00000000	//Disable all others
```

Assign Filters to Masks
```c
MSEL0 = 0b11110000	//Assign Filters 0 to Mask 0, rest to no mask
MSEL1 = 0b11111111	//Assign Filters 4-7 No mask
MSEL2 = 0b11111111	//Assign Filters 8-11 to No mask
MSEL3 = 0b11111111	//Assign Filters 12-15 to No mask
```

Assign Filters to Buffers
```c
RXFBCON0 = 0b00010000	//Assign Filter 0 to RXB0, and Filter 1 to RXB1
RXFBCON1 = 0b11111111	//Assign the rest of the buffers with no filter
RXFBCON2 = 0b11111111;
RXFBCON3 = 0b11111111;
RXFBCON4 = 0b11111111;
RXFBCON5 = 0b11111111;
RXFBCON6 = 0b11111111;
RXFBCON7 = 0b11111111;
```

Initialize Receive Filters. In this example, we are only passing messages with ID=1 and 2 through to the buffers. The SID has been split between two registers, bits SID<10:3> lie in RXFnSIDH and SID<2:0> are in MSBs of RXFnSIDL.

Thus the whole SID  is 0000000000100000.
```c
RXF0SIDH = 0b00000000; // Set to ID1
RXF0SIDL = 0b00100000;

RXF1SIDH = 0b00000000; // Set to ID2
RXF1SIDL = 0b01000000;
```

Telling the RX buffers 0 and 1 to listern to the filters.

```c
RXB0CON = 0x00;
RXB1CON = 0x00;
```


## Normal Mode

Now we can set CAN back to normal mode and this allows it to actually use it.

```c
CANCON = 0b0000000;
```

Now to wait to make sure it got into the normalmode. Another while loop to check CANSTATbits.OPMODE, and wait for it to change to 0b000 before continuing.

```c
while(!(CANSTATbits.OPMODE==0b000));
```


Transmit Function
-----------------

```c
void CAN_Transmit(unsigned char data[8], unsigned int SID, unsigned char DLC)
{
   // We've left out the setup for extended ID transmit buffers, not used for sending standard ID messages, so currently not necessary.
    while(TXB0CONbits.TXREQ == 1); //Wait for last message to clear

/* Standard length ID transmit buffers, the actual identifier lies over the
* two registers, bits SID<10:3> lie in TXBnSIDH and SID<2:0> are in MSBs of
* TXBnSIDL. The TXBnSIDLbits.EXIDE, bit 3 bit should be 0 or 1 for
* standard/extended IDs, respectively. The remainder of TXBnSIDL should be
* set as 0 for standard IDs */
TXB0SIDH = (SID >> 3) & 0b11111111;                           //Thus the SID is 00110010 110 = 406
TXB0SIDL = (SID << 5) & 0b11100000;

/*   The TXBnDLCbits.TXRTR (bit 6) is the remote transmission request bit, and
      tells another node of that ID to send data.
      The TXBnDLCbits.DLC (bits 3:0) is an indication of how many bytes are to be sent, it can range from 0 to 8   */

TXB0DLC = DLC;                            //Thus DLC bytes will be sent! (This is the max)

/*  This is where the meat of the CAN it, this is it!!!!!
The TXBnDm register is the actual data you are to be sending over the
network  */
TXB0D0 = data[0];
TXB0D1 = data[1];
TXB0D2 = data[2];
TXB0D3 = data[3];
TXB0D4 = data[4];
TXB0D5 = data[5];
TXB0D6 = data[6];
TXB0D7 = data[7];

/*This bit literally says go for transmit!!*/
TXB0CONbits.TXREQ = 1;                     //Set the buffer to transmit

}

void CAN_Receive(unsigned char ID)
{
    // Checks if there is data in buffer number [buffer].
    // If there is then it copies register RXBn into the array data1[8]


        if ((RXB0CONbits.RXFUL) && (ID == 1) )          // receive buffer 0
            {
            data1[0] = RXB0D0;
            data1[1] = RXB0D1;
            data1[2] = RXB0D2;
            data1[3] = RXB0D3;
            data1[4] = RXB0D4;
            data1[5] = RXB0D5;
            data1[6] = RXB0D6;
            data1[7] = RXB0D7;

            RXB0CONbits.RXFUL = 0;   // Mark the buffer as read, and no longer contains a new message
            PIR5bits.RXB0IF = 0;     // reset receive buffer 0 interrupt flag
            }

        if ((RXB1CONbits.RXFUL) && (ID == 2) )           // receive buffer 1
        {
                data2[0] = RXB1D0;
                data2[1] = RXB1D1;
                data2[2] = RXB1D2;
                data2[3] = RXB1D3;
                data2[4] = RXB1D4;
                data2[5] = RXB1D5;
                data2[6] = RXB1D6;
                data2[7] = RXB1D7;

                RXB1CONbits.RXFUL = 0;   // Mark the buffer as read, and no longer contains a new message
                PIR5bits.RXB1IF = 0;     // reset receive buffer 1 interrupt flag
        }


}
```
