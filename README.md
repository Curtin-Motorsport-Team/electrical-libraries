========================

A general repository to keep track of the various libraries CMT use in
their electrical projects.


Documentation
-------------

To automatically generate the documentation, use:

    make docs

The documentation will then be placed in the `docs` directory. If your
point your browser at the documentation home page (`docs/html/index.html`),
you'll be able to explore the entire repository. You can explore the
file tree to find the signatures and documentation for pretty much
everything.
